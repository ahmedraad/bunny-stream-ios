## Installation

BunnyNet Stream SDK can be integrated into your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM). Here's how to add it to your project:

### Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
2. Enter the package repository URL:
   
   ```
   https://github.com/BunnyWay/bunny-stream-ios.git
   ```
3. Select the version you want to use:
   
   ```swift
   dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/BunnyWay/bunny-stream-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
   ]
   ```

### Required Permissions

Add the following entries to your Info.plist file:

```xml
<!-- For video upload and download -->

<string>Camera access is required for live streaming</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Microphone access is required for live streaming</string>

<!-- For background upload support -->
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

### Initialization

After installation, you'll need to configure the SDK with your BunnyNet credentials:

```swift
import BunnyStreamSDK

// Initialize the SDK with your access key
let bunnyStreamSDK = BunnyStreamSDK(accessKey: "your_access_key")
```

## Getting Started

This section provides quick examples for each package. For detailed guides, check out our [Documentation](./Documentation).

### 1. BunnyStreamSDK - Video Management

```swift
import BunnyStreamSDK

// Initialize the SDK
let bunnyStreamSDK = BunnyStreamSDK(accessKey: "your_access_key")

// Example: Get video details
let videoInfo = try await bunnyStreamSDK.Api.Video_GetVideo(
    path: .init(
        libraryId: 12345,
        videoId: "abcd-e9bb-4b96-wxyz-c17bc6a5292b"
    )
)
```

### 2. BunnyStreamUploader - File Upload

```swift
import BunnyStreamUploader

// Create uploader instance
let videoUploader = TUSVideoUploader.make(accessKey: "your_access_key")

// Prepare video info
VideoInfo(content: .data(video.data),
                     title: video.name,
                     fileType: video.type,
                     videoId: videoId,
                     libraryId: libraryId)

// Start upload with progress tracking
Task {
    do {
        try await videoUploader.uploadVideos(with: [videoInfo]) { progress in
            print("Upload progress: \(progress.fractionCompleted)")
        }
        print("Upload completed successfully!")
    } catch {
        print("Upload error: \(error)")
    }
}

#### Pause, Resume, and Remove Uploads

For these actions, you'll be using methods from the `VideoUploaderActions` protocol.

This ensures that when the background upload completes, or if there's an error, the `completionHandler` will be called. This will allow the app to update its UI or notify the user, among other possible actions.

In summary, the `TUSVideoUploader` provides an all-in-one solution for robust video uploading, supporting features like pausing, resuming, canceling, and background uploads.

```swift
do {
    try videoUploader.pauseUpload(for: specificUploadInfo)
    try videoUploader.resumeUpload(for: specificUploadInfo)
    try videoUploader.removeUpload(for: specificUploadInfo)
} catch {
    print("Error performing action: \(error)")
}
```

#### Background Mode

When the app goes into the background, especially during an upload, iOS might suspend it after a while. However, with background URL sessions, uploads can continue even when the app is in the background.

In your AppDelegate , when the `handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession` method is triggered, you can hand over the background session handling to the `videoUploader`.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession identifier: String,
                 completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
    videoUploader.registerBackgroundHandler(completionHandler, forSession: identifier)
}
```

### 3. BunnyStreamPlayer - Video Playback

```swift
import BunnyStreamPlayer

BunnyStreamPlayer(
  accessKey: accessKey,
  videoId: videoId,
  libraryId: libraryId,
  cdn: cdnHostname
)
```

**Customizing Player:**

You can customize the BunnyStreamPlayer by passing custom icons. Other costumizations like primary color, font, handling control visibilty, captions, heatmap can be controlled from the BunnyNet dashboard.

```swift
extension BunnyStreamPlayer {
  static func make(videoId: String) -> BunnyStreamPlayer {
    let playerIcons = PlayerIcons(play: Image(systemName: "play.fill"))

    return BunnyStreamPlayer(
      accessKey: accessKey,
      videoId: videoId,
      libraryId: libraryId,
      cdn: cdnHostname,
      playerIcons: playerIcons
    )
  }
}

// Example view
struct VideoPlayerDemoView: View {
    var body: some View {
       BunnyStreamPlayer.make(videoId: videoInfo.id)
       .navigationBarTitle(Text("Video Player"), displayMode: .inline)
    }
}
```

### 4. BunnyStreamCameraUpload

```swift
import BunnyStreamCameraUpload

struct VideoStreamDemoView: View {
  @State private var isStreamingPresented = false

  var body: some View {
    Group { }
      .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $isStreamingPresented,
                       content: {
        BunnyStreamCameraUploadView(
          accessKey: "<access_key>",
          libraryId: <library_id>
        )
      })
  }
}

## Error Handling

The SDK provides detailed error information through custom error types:

```swift
do {
    try await bunnyStreamSDK.Api.Video_DeleteVideo(/* ... */)
} catch let error as BunnyStreamError {
    switch error {
    case .unauthorized:
        print("Invalid access key")
    case .notFound:
        print("Video not found")
    case .networkError(let underlying):
        print("Network error: \(underlying)")
    case .apiError(let status, let message):
        print("API error (\(status)): \(message)")
    }
}
```
